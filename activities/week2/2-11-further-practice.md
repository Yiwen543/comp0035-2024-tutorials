# Activity 2.11: Further practice (optional)

1. Apply the principles to the 'medal_standings' dataframe, e.g.:

    - check for missing values
    - check for issues with categorical data
    - remove columns you don't think you will need
    - check and change datatypes

2. Data preparation with pandas is a popular topic, if you search you can find many tutorials freely available.

3. Use Copilot or chatGPT and ask for advice on using particular pandas functions.

4. Look at Kaggle. There are lots of data sets and often examples of data preparation others have carried out. For
   example look at
   the [120 year of Olympic history](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results).
   This is a larger dataset than the one used in this tutorial and there are many code examples from others that use
   this dataset (some better than others!).
